# Machine-Learning-for-Churn-Detection
In this project, I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain a comprehensive understanding of the dataset. Delving into the data allowed me to uncover patterns, correlations, and potential outliers, providing valuable insights for informed decision-making during the modeling process. To enhance the predictive capabilities of the models, I also performed feature engineering. This included transforming existing features (such as One Hot Encoding using Pd.get_dummies) to capture meaningful information and enhance the performance of the churn detection system. Leveraging the insights from EDA and the engineered features, I trained and evaluated four models: logistic regression, random forest, decision tree, and SGD classifier. Each of these models contributes uniquely to the accuracy and effectiveness of the churn detection system. To share my findings and code, I created a repository where you can explore the EDA process, feature engineering techniques, and the implementation of these models. I am eager to showcase the potential of supervised machine learning, EDA, and feature engineering in churn detection. Feel free to visit the repository, offer feedback, and collaborate. Let's collaborate to enhance churn detection and refine customer retention strategies!
